    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to demonstrate building kerchunk aggregations of **NODD grib2 weather forecasts** fast. This workflow primarily involves [xarray-datatree](https://xarray-datatree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and `grib_tree` function released in **kerchunkv0.2.3** for the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For this operation we will be looking at GRIB2 files generated by [**NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS)**](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-ensemble-forecast), is a weather forecast model made up of 21 separate forecasts, or ensemble members. With global coverage, GEFS is produced four times a day with weather forecasts going out to 16 days, with an update frequency of 4 times a day, every 6 hours starting at midnight.\n",
