    "Just by changing a few lines of code and using `Dask`, we got our code to run **11x faster**. One other detail to note is that there is usually a bit of a delay as `Dask` builds its task graph before any of the tasks are started. All that to say, you may see even better performance when using `Dask`, `VirtualiZarr`, and `Kerchunk` on larger datasets.\n",
