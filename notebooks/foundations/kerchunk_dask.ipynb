    "## Dask and Parallel Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is a `Python` library for parallel computing. It plays well with `Xarray`, but can be used in many ways across the `Python` ecosystem. This notebook is not intended to be a guide for how to use `Dask`, but just an example of how to use `Dask` to parallelize some `Kerchunk` functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook [Multiple Files and Kerchunk](../foundations/kerchunk_multi_file), we were looking at daily downscaled climate data over South-Eastern Alaska. In our function named `generate_json_reference`, we were looping over, one at a time, the input NetCDF4 files and using `Kerchunk's` `SingleHdf5ToZarr` method to create a `Kerchunk` index for each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `Dask`, we can call `SingleHdf5ToZarr` in parallel, which allows us to create multiple `Kerchunk` reference files at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further on in this notebook, we will show how using `Dask` can greatly speed-up the process of creating a virtual dataset using `Kerchunk`\n",
